    <p>GIF Loop Coder (glc) is a JavaScript-based tool for creating looping animated gifs.</p>

    <p>The program is a combination of a JavaScript library that you code against, and a local web application that you run in a browser.</p>
    
    <p>You create a JavaScript file and write code to add animated objects to a render list.</p>

    <p>Your script is loaded by an HTML document that gets run in the browser. The library creates a user interface that shows you the animated ojects you created, gives you a control panel to control how the animation is rendered and lets you save the result as an animated gif.</p>
    
    <img src="images/1.1.png">

    <p>Get the code from <a href="https://github.com/bit101/gifloopcoder">repo address</a>. In the sketches folder, you'll see an <code>index.html</code>, a <code>glcloader.js</code> file, a <code>code</code> folder with a <code>template.js</code> file, and an <code>examples</code> folder with a number of JavaScript files. The project structure should look something like this:</p>

    <div class="code"><pre><code>
- project
  <span class="bold">- sketches
    - index.html
    - glc.loader.js
    - code
      - template.js
    - examples
      - various example js files</span>
  - glc
    - app
    - libs
    </code></pre></div>


    <p>Until you get to the "hacking the mainframe" level, you only really need to worry about that <code>sketches</code> folder. The <code>index.html</code> file looks like this:</p>


    <div class="code"><pre><code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;GIF Loop Coder&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;!-- This should point to the sketch you want to run --&gt;
    <span class="bold">&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="examples/allshapes.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>

    &lt;!-- Don't touch this unless you move your sketches folder. If so, update the path to require.js --&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="../glc/libs/require.js" data-main="glcloader"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
    </code></pre></div>

    <p>You see there are two script files there. The first one points to the sketch that you will create. Here, it's set to load the sketch defined in <code>examples/allshapes.js</code>. To load a different sketch, just change the JavaScript file this points to.</p>

    <p>The second script is to load the glc library. Generally speaking, you shouldn't need to touch that at all.</p>

    <p>In the <code>code</code> folder there is a <code>template.js</code> file that gives you an empty starting point for a project. It looks like this:</p>

    <div class="code"><pre><code>
function onGLC(glc) {
    glc.loop();
    // glc.size(400, 400);
    // glc.setDuration(5);
    // glc.setFPS(20);
    // glc.setMode("single");
    // glc.setEasing(false);
    // glc.setMaxColors(256);
    var list = glc.renderList,
        width = glc.w,
        height = glc.h;

    // your code goes here:



}             
    </code></pre></div>

    <p>The template creates an <code>onGLC</code> function that gets passed an object called <code>glc</code>. That object is all you need to work with the GLC library.</p>

    <p>You can see that the first template calls <code>glc.loop();</code> This will cause the animation to auto-play when the web page is loaded. And you'll see several other methods there, commented out. Those will be discussed a bit later. One I'll mention immediately is the <code>size</code> method. By default, GLC makes a 400x400 pixel animation. You can change that with this method, passing in a new width and height.</p>

    <p>Animations are created by adding objects to the <code>glc.renderList</code>. Rather than typing that out each time, the template creates a short alias called <code>list</code> to make adding objects easier. </p>

    <p>You'll also see that <code>glc.w</code> and <code>glc.h</code>, which represent the width and the height of the current sketch, are aliased to <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, again for ease of typing.

    <p>You probably want to keep that <code>template.js</code> file around for starting new projects. So it's best to save it with a different name and then adjust the HTML to point to wherever that new file is. The <code>code</code> folder is a good place to store your own sketch scripts.</p>

    <p>For example, save a copy of that <code>template.js</code> file as <code>animaton_01.js</code> in the <code>code</code> folder, and then in the HTML, say: </p>


    <div class="code"><pre><code>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src=<span class="bold">"code/animation_01.js"</span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    </code></pre></div>

    <p>There's another way to load a particular sketch dynamically. In the browser, you should see a url something like this:</p>

    <div class="code"><pre><code>
file:///path/to/glc/sketches/index.html
    </code></pre></div>

    <p>To navigate to a particular sketch file, add a <code>#</code> character plus the path to the file you want to load. e.g.:</p>

    <div class="code"><pre><code>
file:///path/to/glc/sketches/index.html<span class="bold">#code/animation_01.js</span>
    </code></pre></div>

    <p>Or, to load something from the <code>examples</code> folder:</p>

    <div class="code"><pre><code>
file:///path/to/glc/sketches/index.html<span class="bold">#examples/allshapes.js</span>
    </code></pre></div>

    <p>Using this method, you can cycle through different sketches without ever leaving the browser.</p>

    <p>So, your app should be running, but you need to add at least one object to have anything interesting to see.</p>

    </div>


    <!-- ================================================================================== -->
    <h3><a name="addingobjects"></a>Adding Objects</h3>
    <!-- ================================================================================== -->
    <div class="subsection">




    <p>The <code>glc.renderList</code>, which we have aliased to <code>list</code>, has a number of "add" methods for adding objects. Let's start by adding a circle.</p>


    <div class="code"><pre><code>
function onGLC(glc) {
    var list = glc.renderList;

    glc.loop();
    // glc.size(400, 400);
    // glc.setDuration(5);
    // glc.setFPS(20);
    // glc.setMode("single");
    // glc.setEasing(false);
    // glc.setMaxColors(256);

    // your code goes here:

    <span class="bold">list.addCircle();</span>

});
    </code></pre></div>


    <p>Now, there are many properties that go into defining a rendered circle: position, radius, stroked or filled or both? Stroke color and width, solid or dashed, fill color, drop shadow parameters. Circles are drawn in HTML5 using the <code>arc</code> method, so we also need to know the start and end angle of that arc. But we don't have to specify anything at all here because glc has defaults for everything. You only need define what you want to be different from the default.</p>

    <p>When you run this, you should see your circle right away.</p>

    <img src="images/1.2.png">

    <p>Now that we have a circle, let's customize it by setting some of its properties. This is all done declaratively, by passing in an object to the <code>addCircle</code> method. Let's set the x and y position so that the circle is centered on the canvas.</p>

    <div class="code"><pre><code>
    ...

    list.addCircle(<span class="bold">{
        x: 200,
        y: 200
    }</span>);

    ...
    </code></pre></div>

    <img src="images/1.3.png">

    <p>Now let's change its radius, and give it a stroke. Then a stroke and fill style (color).</p>

    <div class="code"><pre><code>
    list.addCircle({
        x: 200,
        y: 200,
        <span class="bold">radius: 100,
        stroke: true,
        strokeStyle: "#ff0000",
        fillStyle: "yellow"</span>
    });
    </code></pre></div>

    <img src="images/1.4.png">

    <p>Notice that I set one style using a hex string, and the other using a CSS named color. Just about any standard color string will work. There's more on that in the <a href="properties.html">Properties</a> section.</p>

    <p>Now that we've seen how to add an object, let's look at how to animate it.</p>


    </div>

    <!-- ================================================================================== -->
    <h3><a name="animating"></a>Animating</h3>
    <!-- ================================================================================== -->
    <div class="subsection">

    <p>Animation in glc is done through changing an object from one state to another over time. By state, I mean that the values of one or more of its properties are changed. So, rather than assigning a single value to a property, we animate it by assigning <em>two</em> properties to it. And we do that by assigning an array to that property. For example, to animate the radius of this circle, we just pass in an array, like so:</p>

    <div class="code"><pre><code>
    list.addCircle({
        x: 200,
        y: 200,
        <span class="bold">radius: [20, 100],</span>
        stroke: true,
        strokeStyle: "#ff0000",
        fillStyle: "yellow"
    });
    </code></pre></div>

    <p>Now you should be able to see the circle animating. You can use the stop button to stop it, and the scrubber under the animation to examine the animation frame-by-frame.</p>

    <img src="images/1.5.gif">

    <p>You can animate almost any property of any object. Even colors in any format - hex strings, rgb or rgba strings or even CSS named colors. You can even mix and match formats. It's all good!</p>

    <div class="code"><pre><code>
    list.addCircle({
        x: 200,
        y: 200,
        radius: [20, 100],
        stroke: true,
        <span class="bold">strokeStyle: ["#f00", "#0000ff"],
        fillStyle: ["rgb(255, 255, 0)", "green"]</span>
    });
    </code></pre></div>

    <img src="images/1.6.gif">

    <p>Here, the stroke will animate from red to blue, while the fill animates from yellow to green. You can even animate booleans!</p>

    <div class="code"><pre><code>
    list.addCircle({
        x: 200,
        y: 200,
        radius: [20, 100],
        <span class="bold">stroke: [true, false],</span>
        strokeStyle: ["#f00", "#0000ff"],
        fillStyle: ["rgb(255, 255, 0)", "green"]
    });
    </code></pre></div>

    <img src="images/1.7.gif">

    <p>Of course, there is no way to smoothly ramp up and down from true to false, so the object will get the first value for the first part of the animation and then switch over to the second boolean value. Here that means that the circle will be stroked when its radius is between 20 and 60 and unstroked when it's between 60 and 100.</p>

    <p>Check the other sections of this documentation to find out the different types of objects you can add, the different types of properties you can assign to them and how to animate them. Next up, we'll take a closer look at the user interface.</p>
    </div>


    <!-- ================================================================================== -->
    <h3><a name="ui"></a>GLC User Interface</h3>
    <!-- ================================================================================== -->
    <div class="subsection">

    <p>The key parts of the glc user interface are the Canvas Panel and the Control Panel. The ui is created using the <a href="https://github.com/bit101/quicksettings">QuickSettings library</a>, which you may want to check out for your own projects.</p>

    <p>The Canvas Panel displays the animation in progress. It will be sized to 400x400 pixels, or differently if you called <code>glc.size</code> in your JavaScript file. Note that at the bottom of the panel, there is a scrubber for moving through the animation manually.</p>

    <img src="images/1.1.png">

    <p>The Control Panel is what you'll interact with mostly though. From top to bottom, here's what it does:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The duration slider changes how long the overall animation lasts. It can go from 0.5 seconds up to 10 seconds, in 0.5 second increments.</li>
        <li>The fps slider sets the approximate frame rate in frames per second of the animation. This is accomplished by adding a small delay on each frame. It goes from 1 fps up to 60 fps.</li>
        <li>The max colors slider sets how many colors will be used in the final animation. GIFs have a maximum of 256 colors. But often you can set the max colors much lower and still have your animation look good. This can make a dramatic difference in file size.</li>
        <li>The mode select allows you to choose "bounce" or "single". Modes will be explained a bit more below.</li>
        <li>The easing checkbox gives the animation an ease-in and ease-out to the animation if checked. Otherwise, it performs a straight linear interpolation.</li>
        <li>The Play once button plays the animation through one full cycle and stops.</li>
        <li>The Loop button causes the animation to loop continuously.</li>
        <li>The Stop button causes any animation or rendering to stop.</li>
        <li>The "Make a gif" button causes the animation to play through one time and begins capturing frames. When the animation is done, it assembles the captured frames into an animated gif, which it displays in the Output panel.</li>
        <li>The "Capture still" button will capture the single frame showing in the Canvas panel and display it in the Output panel.</li>
        <li>The status indicator lets you know what's happening</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you ever have a hard time getting one of the sliders to land on a specific value, you can also use the left and right cursor keys on your keyboard. Pressing these will move the slider in single increments one way or the other.</p>

    <p>You can interact with several of the controls here via the code you write. You've already seen that you can call <code>glc.loop()</code> to have your animation start looping as soon as the page loads. Alternately, you could <code>glc.playOnce()</code>. Here are all the available commands:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>glc.loop()</code> - loops the animation continuously when the page loads.</li>
        <li><code>glc.playOnce()</code> - plays the animation through one time when the page loads.</li>
        <li><code>glc.size(w, h)</code> - sets the animation size.</li>
        <li><code>glc.setFPS(num)</code> - sets the frame rate of the animation.</li>
        <li><code>glc.setDuration(num)</code> - sets the duration of the animation.</li>
        <li><code>glc.setMode(mode)</code> - sets the interpolation mode ("bounce" or "single").</li>
        <li><code>glc.setEasing(bool)</code> - sets easing on or off.</li>
        <li><code>glc.setMaxColors(num)</code> - sets the maximum number of colors in your animation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These are all very useful when you are going back and forth between the code and the app a lot, and you want to have your animation play at a particular rate and duration, mode and easing. Just set it once in the code rather than having to tweak the UI each time you reload.</p>

    <p>Finally, the Output panel displays the generated gif or captured image as well as the approximate size that the file will be when you save it. Once it's in there, you can right click it to save it in a specific location with a specific name, or open it in a new tab. You can also choose to clear the image from the panel. Sometimes the right-click to save action will fail on larger animations. If this happens, try dragging and dropping the image into a file system window.</p>

    </div>

    <!-- ================================================================================== -->
    <h3><a name="playback"></a>Animation Playback and Rendering</h3>
    <!-- ================================================================================== -->
    <div class="subsection">

    <p>At the very core of a glc animation is a single property, <code>t</code> that interpolates from 0 to 1. It's at 0 at the start of the animation and 1 at the end. And an ever-increasing fraction in between. </p>

    <p>First lets look at what happens when mode is set to "bounce". Say you've assigned an array of two values to a property, such as <code>x: [100, 300]</code> to a circle's x position. glc will animate that circle so that it increases from an x of 100, up to 300, and then back down to 100 again. That's one cycle of an animation.</p>

    <img src="images/1.8.gif">

    <p>So, when <code>t</code> = 0, <code>x</code> will get 100. As <code>t</code> increases, the x position will start moving from the 100, towards its second value, 300. When <code>t</code> reaches 0.5, it's half way through the animation, and <code>x</code> will be 300. As <code>t</code> increases from 0.5 to 1.0, the x position of the circle will start moving back downwards toward the first value, 100.</p>

    <p>If easing is checked in the Control Panel, then <code>t</code> will change on a curve defined by a sine wave, so it starts increasing slowly, then speeds up, and then slows down as it reaches the end. If easing is off, it just linearly moves from 0 to 1.</p>

    <img src="images/1.9.gif">

    <p>You can see this very clearly by using the scrubber on the Canvas Panel. The value shown there is the <code>t</code> value. When the slider is full left, <code>t</code> is 0 and your animation will be at the starting state. As you drag right, <code>t</code> increases and your animation moves towards the ending state. It should reach that end state just as the slider hits the midpoint at <code>t</code> = 0.5, then start moving back to the starting point as you continue to drag right to <code>t</code> = 1.</p>

    <p>Now, when the mode is set to "single", we have a very different operation. Here, the animation only goes from its start state at <code>t</code> = 0 to its end state at <code>t</code> = 1. You can see this very clearly as well by using the scrubber in the Canvas Panel. First with easing:</p>

    <img src="images/1.10.gif">

    <p>And then without easing:</p>

    <img src="images/1.11.gif">

    <p>Most animations look best in bounce mode because they will automatically loop very smoothly. If you simply move an object in single mode, it will move from its start position to the end position and then suddenly jump back to the start position and start over. To make a good looking single mode animation requires some extra work, usually additional objects to make the overall start state of the animation look exactly the same as the end state. But if done correctly, these can look really great.</p>

    <p>There is more information on how to do this in the <a href="tips.html">Tips</a> section.</p>
